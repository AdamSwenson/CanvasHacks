<p>After the due date of the content assignment for this unit, you will receive 2 things from me via email:</p>
<ol>
<li>Another student's content assignment</li>
<li>The access code to complete this peer-review assignment </li>
</ol>
<p>Please read over their assignment carefully (at least twice) and then answer these questions. The answers you give will affect the other student's grade on the assignment and will be the main form of feedback they receive. Therefore, it is essential that you be thoughtful, honest, and clear in your feedback. </p>
<p>There is no curve for these assignments. Therefore, there is no incentive to give dishonest scores.</p>
<p>This peer review assignment is worth 3 points:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">1 point for completion</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Up to 2 points for quality</p>
<p>Feedback is of high quality when it is thoughtful, clear, and (in the essay answers) presented with both honesty and kindness. </p>
<p>The author will rate the quality of your feedback in the metareview assignment. Their rating will affect the grade you receive. I will also be comparing your feedback to my own impression of the author's work when I determine your grade for this peer review</p>
<p>Note: Canvas will automatically give you full credit (3 points) when you submit this. However, since there's only 1 point for completing it, your grade may go down once I have graded it.</p>
