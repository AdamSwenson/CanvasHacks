<p>In this assignment you will provide feedback to the person who reviewed the work you submitted in the Content Assignment.</p>
<p>After the due date of the peer review assignment for this unit, you will receive 2 things from me via email:</p>
<ol>
<li>Feedback from the person who reviewed your work</li>
<li>The access code to complete this assignment </li>
</ol>
<p>Please read over their feedback carefully (at least twice) and then answer these questions. The answers you give will affect the other student's peer review grade. More importantly, it will help them give better feedback in the future. Therefore, it is essential that you be thoughtful, honest, and clear in your feedback. </p>
<p>There is no curve for these assignments. Therefore, there is no incentive to give dishonest scores.</p>
<p>Receiving critical feedback is always difficult. However, it is also essential to improvement.  While I'm asking you to give feedback on the feedback you received, please take this opportunity to practice honestly evaluating your own performance without falling into the twin traps of dismissing your critic as completely wrong or giving up and assuming that they are completely right. Here are 2 tricks which help me: (1) Remember that the feedback is just about the words you wrote on the assignment, it has nothing to do with you as a person or even as a student; (2) Tell yourself that the person giving you feedback is trying to help you improve (for outside of class: this lets you mentally recast an angry critic as passionate about helping you).</p>
