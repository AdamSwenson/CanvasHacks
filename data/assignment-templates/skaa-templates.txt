You will not be able to successfully complete the assignment without reading / watching the course materials (probably several times as you work on this).</p>\n<p>You will receive a small amount of credit for completing this assignment. Most of your grade will be based on how well you answer the question.</p>\n<p>There is no official minimum page length / word count. However, I expect the vast majority of you will need the equivalent of at least 2.5 typed pages (double-spaced) to fully answer the question.</p>\n<p>There is no time-limit (other than its due date); you can open the assignment and look at it as many times as you want.</p>\n<p>It\'s a good idea to write your answers in a file on your computer (Google Docs, whatever) and then copy-paste them here. That way you won\'t lose your work if your connection times out, et cetera.</p>\n<p>Here is the rubric that will be used to grade your answer: <a class="instructure_file_link instructure_scribd_file" title="Unit 1 Rubric for the peer review.pdf" href="https://canvas.csun.edu/courses/77522/files/8173923/download?verifier=GsZ8RVm8u82SXaIdQo61YfSe4mBuA4WOforTfdrY&amp;wrap=1" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.csun.edu/api/v1/courses/77522/files/8173923" data-api-returntype="File">Unit 1 Rubric for the peer review.pdf</a></p>\n</div>',
