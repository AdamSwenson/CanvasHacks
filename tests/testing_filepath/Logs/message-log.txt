Unit 1: Another student's essay to peer review 

    Hi  Student Test,
    
    Here is another student's assignment for you to review:
    =======================
    
    
            ------
    Prompt: body

    Their response:
    Strategic Plan and Roadmap for Expanding ASCSU Democratic/Shared Governance Autonomy & Authority 
Contrasting ASCSU vs. UC Academic Senate Authority and Autonomy 
Currently, the UC Academic Senate’s authority comes from the California Constitution (Article IX, Section 9), which grants the University of California a unique constitutional status and gives its Academic Senate “direct participation in the governance of the University.” The Academic Senate of the California State University (ASCSU), by contrast, derives its authority from statute and the CSU Board of Trustees, not the Constitution. This difference is why the UC Senate has true autonomous power, while the ASCSU operates in a more advisory and consultative capacity. 
That said, there are several realistic pathways the ASCSU could pursue to expand its autonomy and strengthen its governance authority: 

 Pursue statutory change in the California Education Code

The CSU’s powers are defined by the Education Code (Sections 89000–90000). The ASCSU could advocate for amendments that codify faculty primacy in core academic areas—curriculum, admissions, degree requirements, and faculty governance—mirroring UC’s constitutional autonomy within the CSU’s statutory framework. 

This would require legislative advocacy and partnership with the California Faculty Association (CFA) and student/faculty coalitions.  


It could establish ASCSU as the final authority (rather than advisory) on specific academic matters. 


 Strengthen the Standing Orders of the CSU Board of Trustees

Like the UC Regents, the CSU Trustees can delegate authority through their Standing Orders. 

The ASCSU could propose amendments granting formal delegated authority over curriculum approval, degree standards, and faculty governance policies.  


This approach does not require legislation—only Board action—but depends on political will and negotiation. 


 Build a unified governance front across constituencies

The ASCSU could partner with: 

Campus senates, to pass coordinated resolutions asserting faculty primacy in academic matters.  


CFA and California Faculty Council, to create political momentum and public framing around “academic freedom and governance integrity.”  


Student and staff organizations, to frame the issue as protecting educational quality, not faculty privilege. 


 Engage in a constitutional strategy (long-term)

Although very difficult, the CSU could seek constitutional status similar to UC—via a constitutional amendment (requiring a statewide ballot initiative). 

This would enshrine CSU’s academic governance autonomy and make ASCSU a constitutional body.  


It’s a high-bar, long-term strategy, but framing it around public trust and depoliticizing higher education could gain traction over time. 


 Institutionalize shared governance mechanisms

In the near term, ASCSU can: 

Negotiate binding memoranda of understanding (MOUs) with the Chancellor’s Office on decision-making procedures.  


Push for policy codification (e.g., revisions to Executive Orders or coded memoranda) that require joint decision-making authority rather than consultation.  


Establish faculty review boards that have binding input on academic policy, similar to UC’s Senate committees. 


 Leverage moral and public authority

Even without formal autonomy, ASCSU can strengthen its de facto power by: 

Demonstrating scholarly legitimacy and policy expertise.  


Building transparent and inclusive processes that command respect from campus presidents, trustees, and legislators.  


Publishing policy briefs and public statements positioning ASCSU as the guardian of academic integrity across CSU. 

Strategic Roadmap for Expanding ASCSU Autonomy 

 Background and Rationale

The Academic Senate of the California State University (ASCSU) plays a central role in shared governance, but its authority is largely consultative under current CSU policy and statutory frameworks. By contrast, the University of California Academic Senate exercises constitutionally protected authority over core academic matters, as granted by Article IX, Section 9 of the California Constitution and the Standing Orders of the Regents. 
To preserve academic integrity, faculty voice, and educational quality in the CSU, the ASCSU should pursue a phased strategy to increase its de jure and de facto autonomy. 
 

 Short-Term (1–2 Years): Strengthening De Facto Authority

Goals: 

Build institutional legitimacy and leverage within existing governance structures.  


Expand influence through formalized partnerships and procedural safeguards.  

Actions: 

Negotiate Standing Agreements with the Chancellor’s Office  


Develop and adopt MOUs specifying areas of joint decision-making (e.g., curriculum, academic standards, degree programs).  


Create timelines and accountability mechanisms ensuring faculty input before policy issuance.  


Codify Shared Governance in CSU Executive Orders  


Propose revisions to key Executive Orders (EOs) to require “joint approval” or “concurrence” from ASCSU on all academic matters.  


Example: “Changes to general education requirements shall require concurrence by the ASCSU.”  


Coordinate with Campus Senates  


Establish a Systemwide Governance Council of campus senate chairs and ASCSU leadership.  


Pass parallel resolutions asserting faculty primacy in academic policy across all campuses.  


Enhance Public Visibility and Moral Authority  


Publish annual State of Academic Governance reports.  


Issue policy briefs and op-eds positioning ASCSU as the guardian of academic integrity and quality in public higher education. 


 Medium-Term (3–5 Years): Building Formal Delegation of Authority

Goals: 

Secure legal and policy recognition of ASCSU’s decision-making role.  


Embed autonomy into CSU governance documents.  

Actions: 

Amend the CSU Board of Trustees’ Standing Orders  


Advocate for inclusion of a clause paralleling UC’s:   “The Academic Senate shall determine academic policy, subject to approval by the Board.”   


Establish a Joint Committee on Academic Policy (Board + ASCSU) to oversee delegation transitions.  


Legislative Engagement  


Collaborate with the California Faculty Association (CFA) and legislative allies to propose amendments to the California Education Code:  


Codify faculty primacy in curriculum and degree requirements.  


Define the ASCSU as the official policy body on academic affairs within CSU.  


Example statutory addition:   “The Academic Senate of the California State University shall have primary responsibility for the formulation and review of academic policy, subject to the authority of the Board of Trustees.”  


Develop a CSU Academic Freedom and Governance Policy  


Model after the UC Academic Personnel Manual (APM-010) and AAUP principles.  


Embed the concept of faculty autonomy in academic judgment.  


 Long-Term (5–10+ Years): Pursuing Structural or Constitutional Autonomy

Goals: 

Achieve constitutional or quasi-constitutional protection for CSU academic governance.  


Align CSU governance authority with the UC model.  

Actions: 

Constitutional Amendment Initiative  


Advocate for a California Constitutional amendment granting the CSU limited constitutional autonomy for academic governance, while maintaining public accountability.  


Potential wording:   “The California State University shall constitute a public trust, with the Academic Senate exercising authority over academic standards, subject to the general oversight of the Board of Trustees.”  


Coalition-Building for Public Advocacy  


Form an alliance of ASCSU, CFA, CSSA (student association), and alumni groups.  


Frame the movement as protecting educational quality and depoliticized academic governance.  


Develop a Vision Document  


Publish “Autonomy for Academic Integrity: A 2035 Vision for CSU Shared Governance,” outlining principles, benefits, and models.

 Conclusion

The ASCSU cannot immediately replicate UC’s constitutionally grounded autonomy. However, through incremental statutory, policy, and coalition strategies, it can progressively transform its advisory role into one of shared authority. This evolution will not only strengthen faculty governance but also uphold the CSU’s public mission to deliver high-quality, equitable education through academic independence and professional expertise.
