As a result, their ability of choice was eliminated, therefore the ice cream was a non-autonomous desire.",0.0,"Q: How does lack of choice compromise free will to act?

A: Persuasive advertising acts on unconscious desires therefore eliminating the ability of free choice. In order to fulfill these unconscious desires, we must act on them, however, acting upon these desires are involuntary if the desires were not made consciously/autonomously.

They have the name of the drug, dosage, what it's used for, how it compares to other drugs on the market, possible side effects, in which case to use it, ingredients, and health warnings. ",0.0,"It matters that the desires activated by persuasive advertising are unconscious because it's as if the person is being unknowingly and subconsciously manipulated. For example, in the Victoria's secret commercials, a desire is created in the person viewing the ad to be more attractive and desirable. They may not have had this sense or feeling before watching the ad but after seeing it, but these desires creep their way into the person's mind, or the ad can awaken a dormant desire that the person wasn't feeling, which is just as bad. So, the person ends up buying a product not really what it's for but for the unconscious conception of what they believe it will make them become. ",0.0,"An example of informational advertising which crisp might find objectionable can be quick-fix weight loss solution ads. They are advertised to be detox drinks or pills that can aid you in lowering weight and finally being able to wear the clothes you want and feel good in your body and avoid being diagnosed with unnecessary and avoidable diseases that can arise from excessive weight gain, such as type 2 diabetes. It was advertised as a good thing but they can bring about issues in people such as body dysmorphia, anorexia, or other body image issues and eating disorders. ",0.0,"According to Crisp,  if someone buys ice cream because they had the desire to do so after they've been shown the clip it wouldn't be an autonomous decision. A person didn't initially have a desire for ice cream but since seeing the clip in the movie, it sparked a desire in them. It was simply the result of being exposed to something they had no genuine, natural desire of seeking. ",0.0,"Would Crisp find it objectionable for a private, prestigious university to advertise (informationally) in a historically low-income neighborhood? Explain why or why not. 

Crisp would find this objectionable because he states , in his liquor example, that it's wrong to put rehab advertisements in front of liquor stores and the same goes here. It's wrong to advertise things that are out of reach to the audience you are advertising to, which in this case would be the low-income neighborhood. Not only won't it really benefit anyone but it will cause har, because most kids seeing it know that it is financially out of reach for them.

If the consumer knew they were being manipulated, like by an actor in a film manipulates the viewers emotions consensually, then there would not be as much of a problem with the advertising.

Someone who is brain-washed cannot accept the explanation of the origin of their beliefs, while continuing to hold them as true. The same cannot be said for liberal education, where one can accept their beliefs because of their education and continue to hold those beliefs as true. Persuasive advertising works much like the case of brain-washing, where the consumer is subject to manipulation by others, without good reason; one cannot accept the reasoning behind persuasive advertising and continue to hold that reason as true for why they might have chose to consume that product.",0.0,6,0,0.0

Like the ice cream example Crisp mentioned, it could drive consumers to unconsciously purchase something without having enough information about it. This could make the purchase more of an impulse buy rather than a purchase that has been well thought out about. For example, popcorn and soda commercials in movie theaters expose movie-goers to purchase popcorn and soda to enjoy while watching the movie. This could motivate consumers who originally did not want popcorn or soda to go purchase it. Major companies can take advantage of the fact that they can draw consumers in by advertising in this way, leading many people to unconsciously purchase their products no matter what the product may be.",0.0,An example of informational advertising which Crisp might find objectionable is tobacco advertising. Crisp mentioned that this is wrong because it could be directed towards the wrong audience and advertising companies are to be questioned about this situation.,0.0,"According to Crisp, if people in the audience decide to purchase ice cream after watching the advertisement, they are purchasing it not because they want it but because they have been exposed to it subliminally. 

Crisp decided to purchase a jacket after seeing an advertisement that said there was a sale happening. With this being said, he mentioned that the jacket purchase is autonomous because he still needs to decide if he can afford it, what style he likes, and what color he prefers.

Crisp argues that this example is not a persuasive example and states how an example like this is more related to puffery. He gives an example of someone using Grecian Formula 16 and is then shown in a position of authority and then surrounded admiring members of the opposite sex. The ad of the product implies that having hair colored by the product will lead to positions of power and attract the opposite sex.

According to Crisp, much like the Grecian Formula example laid out in the article, this Carl’s Jr. ad would also be an example of persuasive advertising because “the real reasons for my purchase are my unconscious desires for power and sex.” ",0.0,"Informational advertising differs from persuasive advertising in that the main objective of informational advertising is to inform consumers on product features, benefits, pricing, etc. One example of informational advertising would be drug commercials.

Unconscious desires placed through persuasive advertising are done without consent, which is the manifestation of a person’s autonomy. Therefore, unconscious desires activated through persuasive advertising are wrong because they violate a person's autonomy. ",0.0,"Crisp argues that all forms of advertising should evaluate their values and whether or not the product they are producing has genuine value.

Crisp would most likely agree with the prosecutors in the trials against JUUL for advertising their products to minors.",0.0,"In Crisp’s eyes, this would not be an autonomous choice on behalf of the consumer. Because the splicing of the ice cream was done onto the consumer without their knowledge or consent, “They did not buy the ice cream because they happened to like it and decided they would buy some, but rather because they had been subjected to subliminal suggestion.” This form of subliminal messaging violates a person’s autonomy because it places an unconscious desire into the mind of a consumer, which can cause a person to act in order to fill these desires that weren't even theirs to begin with. ",0.0,"Is all manipulation wrong in Crisp’s eyes? Explain why or why not.

Crisp explains that not all manipulation is wrong, but manipulation is only wrong when it is both against the persons knowledge and for no good reason. However, there are instances of manipulation that are acceptable to Crisp like watching a movie. The actors are manipulating the viewers by portraying a person who isn’t him, but this is not wrong in Crisp’s eyes because it is for reasons we can accept because it is with our knowledge.",0.0,6,0,0.0

But perhaps, the viewer finds themselves ordering the burger, because they might believe a women, representing the ad, might find them attractive. Or perhaps, that they will find a women like that. It is clear and known that sex sells. Using women in a sexual fashion to advertise something is not uncommon.

A: Crisp does not find it okay to use persuasive advertising, as he believes the persuasion method of advertising do not lead to a fully autonomous action.  Yes, it does have a link to puffery, as puffery is explained by Crisp as ""the unconscious desire of consumers for power, wealth, status, sex, and so on; and repetition which is self-explanatory, the name of the product being ""drummed into' the mind of the consumer. "" By this innate desire for power and sex, the way advertisers use this is, by linking the product to this desire, along side another reason. For example, the Carl's Jr, example I used.
